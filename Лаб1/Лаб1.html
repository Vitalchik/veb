    <h2 style="text-align:center;">DIVING IN</h2>
<p><img	 src="http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/i/aoc-p.png" alt="">ersistent local storage is one of the areas where native client applications have held an advantage over web applications. For native applications, the operating system typically provides an abstraction layer for storing and retrieving application-specific data like preferences or runtime state. These values may be stored in the registry, INI files, XML files, or some other place according to platform convention. If your native client application needs local storage beyond key/value pairs, you can embed your own database, invent your own file format, or any number of other solutions.
<p>Historically, web applications have had none of these luxuries. Cookies were invented early in the webs history, and indeed they can be used for persistent local storage of small amounts of data. But they have three potentially dealbreaking downsides:

<ul>
<li>Cookies are included with every  request, thereby slowing down your web application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over
<li>Cookies are included with every  request, thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet (unless your entire web application is served over)
<li>Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data mdash; enough to slow down your application (see above), but not enough to be terribly useful
</ul>
<p>What we really want is
<ul>
<li>a lot of storage space
<li>on the client
<li>that persists beyond a page refresh
<li>and isnt transmitted to the server
</ul>
<p>Before , all attempts to achieve this were ultimately unsatisfactory in different ways.

<h2 style="text-align:center">A Brief History of Local Storage Hacks Before HTML5</h2>
<p>In the beginning, there was only Internet Explorer. Or at least, thats what Microsoft wanted the world to think. To that end, as part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars#The_first_browser_war">First Great Browser Wars</a>, Microsoft invented a great many things and included them in their browser-to-end-all-browser-wars, Internet Explorer. One of these things was called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms531078(v=VS.85).aspx"> Behaviors</a>, and one of these behaviors was called <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms531078(v=VS.85).aspx">userData</a>.

……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….

<p style="text-align:center;">❧</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Introducing HTML5 Storage</h2>

<p>What I will refer to as <abbr>HTML5</abbr> Storage is a specification named <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/">Web Storage</a>, which was at one time part of the <abbr>HTML5</abbr> specification proper, but was split out into its own specification for uninteresting political reasons. Certain browser vendors also refer to it as Local Storage or <abbr>DOM</abbr> Storage. The naming situation is made even more complicated by some related, similarly-named, emerging standards that Ill discuss later in this chapter.

<p>So what is <abbr>HTML5</abbr> Storage? Simply put, it is a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. Like cookies, this data persists even after you navigate away from the web site, close your browser tab, exit your browser, or what have you. Unlike cookies, this data is never transmitted to the remote web server (unless you go out of your way to send it manually). Unlike <a href=#history>all previous attempts</a> at providing persistent local storage, it is implemented natively in web browsers, so it is available even when third-party browser plugins are not.

<p>Which browsers? Well, the latest version of pretty much every browser supports <abbr>HTML5</abbr> Storage even Internet Explorer!

<table>
<caption><abbr>HTML5</abbr> Storage support</caption>
<thead>
<tr><th title="Internet Explorer">IE<th title="Mozilla Firefox">Firefox<th title="Apple Safari">Safari<th title="Google Chrome">Chrome<th>Opera<th>iPhone<th>Android
<tbody>
<tr><td>8.0+<td>3.5+<td>4.0+<td>4.0+<td>10.5+<td>2.0+<td>2.0+
</table>

<p>From your JavaScript code, you will access <abbr>HTML5</abbr> Storage through the <code>localStorage</code> object on the global <code>window</code> object. Before you can use it, you should <a href=http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/detect.html#storage>detect whether the browser supports it</a>.

 check for <abbr>HTML5</abbr> Storage
<pre><code>function supports_html5_storage() {
  try {
    return 'localStorage' in window && window['localStorage'] !== null;
  } catch (e) {
    return false;
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>Instead of writing this function yourself, you can use <a href=detect.html#modernizr>Modernizr</a> to detect support for <abbr>HTML5</abbr> Storage.

<pre><code>if (<mark>Modernizr.localstorage</mark>) {
  // window.localStorage is available!
} else {
  // no native support for HTML5 storage :(
  // maybe try dojox.storage or a third-party solution
}</code></pre>

<p style="text-align:center;">❧</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">Using HTML5 Storage</h2>

<p><abbr>HTML5</abbr> Storage is based on named key/value pairs. You store data based on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key. The named key is a string. The data can be any type supported by JavaScript, including strings, Booleans, integers, or floats. However, the data is actually stored as a string. If you are storing and retrieving anything other than strings, you will need to use functions like <code>parseInt()</code> or <code>parseFloat()</code> to coerce your retrieved data into the expected JavaScript datatype.

<pre><code>interface Storage {
  getter any getItem(in DOMString key);
  setter creator void setItem(in DOMString key, in any data);
};</code></pre>
<p>Calling <code>setItem()</code> with a named key that already exists will silently overwrite the previous value. Calling <code>getItem()</code> with a non-existent key will return <code>null</code> rather than throw an exception.
<p>Like other JavaScript objects, you can treat the <code>localStorage</code> object as an associative array. Instead of using the <code>getItem()</code> and <code>setItem()</code> methods, you can simply use square brackets. For example, this snippet of code:
<pre><code>var foo = localStorage.<mark>getItem</mark>("bar");
// ...
localStorage.<mark>setItem</mark>("bar", foo);</code></pre>
<p>could be rewritten to use square bracket syntax instead:
<pre><code>var foo = localStorage<mark>["bar"]</mark>;
// ...
localStorage<mark>["bar"]</mark> = foo;</code></pre>
<p>There are also methods for removing the value for a given named key, and clearing the entire storage area (that is, deleting all the keys and values at once).
<pre><code>interface Storage {
  deleter void removeItem(in DOMString key);
  void clear();
};</code></pre>
<p>Calling <code>removeItem()</code> with a non-existent key will do nothing.
<p>Finally, there is a property to get the total number of values in the storage area, and to iterate through all of the keys by index (to get the name of each key).
<pre><code>interface Storage {
  readonly attribute unsigned long length;
  getter DOMString key(in unsigned long index);
};</code></pre>

<p>If you call key() with an index that is not between 0-(length-1), the function will return <code>null</code>.
……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..

<pre><code>if (window.addEventListener) {
  window.addEventListener("storage", handle_storage, false);
} else {
  window.attachEvent("onstorage", handle_storage);
};</code></pre>
<p>The <code>handle_storage</code> callback function will be called with a <code>StorageEvent</code> object, except in Internet Explorer where the event object is stored in <code>window.event</code>.
<pre><code>function handle_storage(e) {
  if (!e) { e = window.event; }
}</code></pre>
<p>At this point, the variable <code>e</code> will be a <code>StorageEvent</code> object, which has the following useful properties.

<table >
<caption>StorageEvent Object</caption>
<thead>
<tr><th>Property<th>Type<th>Description
<tbody>
<tr><th><code>key</code><td>string<td>the named key that was added, removed, or modified
<tr><th><code>oldValue</code><td>any<td>the previous value (now overwritten), or <code>null</code> if a new item was added
<tr><th><code>newValue</code><td>any<td>the new value, or <code>null</code> if an item was removed
<tr><th><code>url</code><sup>*</sup><td>string<td>the page which called a method that triggered this change
<tfoot>
<tr><td></td>Note: the <code>url</code> property was originally called <code>uri</code>. Some browsers shipped with that property before the specification changed. For maximum compatibility, you should check whether the <code>url</code> property exists, and if not, check for the <code>uri</code> property instead.
</table>

<p>The <code>storage</code> event is not cancelable. From within the <code>handle_storage</code> callback function, there is no way to stop the change from occurring. It is simply a way for the browser to tell you, hey, this just happened. There is nothing you can do about it now; I just wanted to let you know.

<h3 style="text-align:center">Limitations in Current Browsers</h3>

………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………...
<p style="text-align:center;">❧</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center"">HTML5 Storage in Action</h2>
<p>Let is see <abbr>HTML5</abbr> Storage in action. Recall <a href="">the Halma game we constructed in the canvas chapter</a>. There is a small problem with the game: if you close the browser window mid-game, you will lose your progress. But with <abbr>HTML5</abbr> Storage, we can save the progress locally, within the browser itself. Here is <a href=examples/localstorage-halma.html>a live demonstration</a>. Make a few moves, then close the browser tab, then re-open it. If your browser supports <abbr>HTML5</abbr> Storage, the demonstration page should magically remember your exact position within the game, including the number of moves you made, the position of each of the pieces on the board, and even whether a particular piece is selected.
<p>How does it work? Every time a change occurs within the game, we call this function:
<pre><code>function saveGameState() {
    if (!supportsLocalStorage()) { return false; }
    localStorage["halma.game.in.progress"] = gGameInProgress;
    for (var i = 0; i  kNumPieces; i++) {
	localStorage["halma.piece." + i + ".row"] = gPieces[i].row;
	localStorage["halma.piece." + i + ".column"] = gPieces[i].column;
    }
    localStorage["halma.selectedpiece"] = gSelectedPieceIndex;
    localStorage["halma.selectedpiecehasmoved"] = gSelectedPieceHasMoved;
    localStorage["halma.movecount"] = gMoveCount;
    return true;
}</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it uses the <code>localStorage</code> object to save whether there is a game in progress (<code>gGameInProgress</code>, a Boolean). If so, it iterates through the pieces (<code>gPieces</code>, a JavaScript <code>Array</code>) and saves the row and column number of each piece. Then it saves some additional game state, including which piece is selected (<code>gSelectedPieceIndex</code>, an integer), whether the piece is in the middle of a potentially long series of hops (<code>gSelectedPieceHasMoved</code>, a Boolean), and the total number of moves made so far (<code>gMoveCount</code>, an integer).
<p>On page load, instead of automatically calling a <code>newGame()</code> function that would reset these variables to hard-coded values, we call a <code>resumeGame()</code> function instead. Using <abbr>HTML5</abbr> Storage, the <code>resumeGame()</code> function checks whether a state about a game-in-progress is stored locally. If so, it restores those values using the <code>localStorage</code> object.
<pre><code>function resumeGame() {
    if (!supportsLocalStorage()) { return false; }
    gGameInProgress = (localStorage["halma.game.in.progress"] == "true");
    if (!gGameInProgress) { return false; }
    gPieces = new Array(kNumPieces);
    for (var i = 0; i kNumPieces; i++) {
	var row = parseInt(localStorage["halma.piece." + i + ".row"]);
	var column = parseInt(localStorage["halma.piece." + i + ".column"]);
	gPieces[i] = new Cell(row, column);
    }
    gNumPieces = kNumPieces;
    gSelectedPieceIndex = parseInt(localStorage["halma.selectedpiece"]);
    gSelectedPieceHasMoved = localStorage["halma.selectedpiecehasmoved"] == "true";
    gMoveCount = parseInt(localStorage["halma.movecount"]);
    drawBoard();
    return true;
}</code></pre>
<p>The most important part of this function is the caveat that I mentioned earlier in this chapter, which I will repeat here: <em>Data is stored as strings. If you are storing something other than a string, you will need to coerce it yourself when you retrieve it.</em> For example, the flag for whether there is a game in progress (<code>gGameInProgress</code>) is a Boolean. In the <code>saveGameState()</code> function, we just stored it and did not worry about the datatype:
<pre><code>localStorage["halma.game.in.progress"] = <mark>gGameInProgress</mark>;</code></pre>
<p>But in the <code>resumeGame()</code> function, we need to treat the value we got from the local storage area as a string and manually construct the proper Boolean value ourselves:
<pre><code>gGameInProgress = (localStorage["halma.game.in.progress"] <mark>== "true"</mark>);</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, the number of moves is stored in <code>gMoveCount</code> as an integer. In the <code>saveGameState()</code> function, we just stored it:
<pre><code>localStorage["halma.movecount"] = <mark>gMoveCount</mark>;</code></pre>
<p>But in the <code>resumeGame()</code> function, we need to coerce the value to an integer, using the <code>parseInt()</code> function built into JavaScript:
<pre><code>gMoveCount = <mark>parseInt</mark>(localStorage["halma.movecount"]);</code></pre>
<p style="text-align:center;">❧</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">Beyond Named Key-Value Pairs: Competing Visions</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <b>actual working code in 4 browsers</b></p>
<pre><code><mark>openDatabase</mark>('documents', '1.0', 'Local document storage', 5*1024*1024, function (db) {
  db.changeVersion('', '1.0', function (t) {
    t.<mark>executeSql</mark>('CREATE TABLE docids (id, name)');
  }, error);
});</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, most of the action resides in the string you pass to the <code>executeSql</code> method. This string can be any supported <abbr>SQL</abbr> statement, including <code>SELECT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, and <code>DELETE</code> statements. Iti s just like backend database programming, except you are doing it from JavaScript! Oh joy!
<p>The Web SQL Database specification has been implemented by four browsers and platforms.

<p>Of course, if you used more than one database product in your life, you are aware that <abbr>SQL</abbr> is more of a marketing term than a hard-and-fast standard. (Some would say the same of HTML5, but never mind that.) Sure, there is an actual <abbr>SQL</abbr> specification (it is called <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shadow/sql/sql1992.txt">SQL-92</a>), but there is no database server in the world that conforms to that and only that specification. There is Oracle is <abbr>SQL</abbr>, Microsoft is <abbr>SQL</abbr>, MySQL is <abbr>SQL</abbr>, PostgreSQL is <abbr>SQL</abbr>, and SQLite is <abbr>SQL</abbr>. Indeed, each of these products adds new <abbr>SQL</abbr> features over time, so even saying SQLite is <abbr>SQL</abbr> is not sufficient to pin down exactly what you are talking about. You need to say the version of <abbr>SQL</abbr> that shipped with SQLite version X.Y.Z.
<p>All of which brings us to the following disclaimer, currently residing at the top of the Web SQL Database specification:
<blockquote>
<p>This specification has reached an impasse: all interested implementors have used the same SQL backend (Sqlite), but we need multiple independent implementations to proceed along a standardisation path. Until another implementor is interested in implementing this spec, the description of the SQL dialect has been left as simply a reference to Sqlite, which isn't acceptable for a standard.
